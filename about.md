## Background

I was born in Austin, Texas, where I spent the first 18 years of my life and where my parents and older brother still live. In 2014, upon graduating Westwood High School, I left home to attend Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. Despite never visiting the campus until move in day of freshman year, I instantly fell in love with PNW and the people around me. At WWU I studied mathematics and computer science, completing my double major bachelor's degree in June 2018. During that time I discovered a passion for data science and machine learning, and I intend to continue pursuing these fields for the near and distant future.

## Academic Overview

I graduated from Westwood High School in 2014 with a 4.0 GPA.

In June 2018, I graduated from Western Washington University with two Bachelor's of Science degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a combined GPA of 3.9.

Below are some highlighted elective courses I've taken, along with brief descriptions and projects completed therein. 

<details>
  <summary><strong> Artificial Intelligence </strong></summary>

#### CSCI 402
  </div></center>
   
**Description:** Introduction to knowledge representation and search. Possible application areas include natural language, perception, learning and expert systems.

**Coursework** 
* [Virtual Fish - Selection (C#)](https://github.com/joshualoehr/VirtualFishSelection): Modifications to the original [VirtualFish project](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1074915/AI-Genetic-Evolution-of-Virtual-Fish) involving refactoring and an assortment of alternative selection strategies for the genetic algorithm.
* [Neural Network from Scratch (C++)](https://github.com/joshualoehr/neural-network-from-scratch): A very basic artificial neural network, built from scratch in C++ with the [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org).
* [Grid QLearn (C#)](https://github.com/joshualoehr/Grid-QLearn): Use Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) to teach a robot to navigate the WWU computer science department in a gridded environment.

*Grade recieved:* **A** (4.0)

  <summary><strong> Natural Language Processing </strong></summary>
  <div markdown="1">
  
  <center><div markdown="1">

#### CSCI 404
  </div></center>
  
  **Description:** Fundamental concepts and ideas in natural language processing (NLP), and current research in the area; algorithms available for the processing of linguistic information and the underlying computational properties of natural languages. Word level, syntactic, and semantic processing from both a linguistic and an algorithmic perspective are considered. The focus is on modern quantitative techniques in NLP: using large corpora, including the web, statistical models for acquisition, disambiguation, and parsing.

  **Coursework** 
  * [N-Gram Language Model (Python)](https://github.com/joshualoehr/ngram-language-model): Python implementation of an N-gram language model with Laplace smoothing and sentence generation.
  * [Various Assignments (Python)](https://github.com/joshualoehr/natural-language-processing): A hodge podge of small assignments from the course, which I should probably clean up and organize into more viewable.
  * Automatic Summarization of Academic Papers (Python): Final project. Attempted to automatically summarize academic papers using an RNN.

  *Grade recieved:* **A** (4.0)

<details>
  <summary><strong> Machine Learning Algorithms </strong></summary>
  <div markdown="1">
  
  <center><div markdown="1">

#### CSCI 571
  </div></center>
  
  **Description:** Covers important machine learning research areas such as artificial neural nets, Bayesian learning, data mining, decision tree learning, evolutionary computation, reinforcement learning, version space learning, rough sets, and computational learning theory. Algorithms from these research areas will be analyzed. Each student will select one of the learned algorithms and apply it to the term project.

  **Coursework** 
  * [Linear Regression (Java)](https://github.com/joshualoehr/linear-regression): General purpose linear regression optimizer implemented from scratch with Java. Options for both gradient descent and analytical solutions.
  * [Tensorflow DNN (Python)](https://github.com/joshualoehr/tensorflow-dnn/blob/master/prog2.py): A general purpose deep neural network implemented in Tensorflow. Uses purely the base Tensorflow library - no 3rd party additions or the contrib package.
  * Final Project (Python): TBA
