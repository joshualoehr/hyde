If you'd like to get in contact with me, shoot me an email at [joshualoehr@gmail.com](mailto:joshualoehr@gmail.com). Thanks for stopping by!

## Background

I was born in Austin, Texas, where I spent the first 18 years of my life and where my parents and older brother still live. In 2014, upon graduating at Westwood High School, I left home to attend Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. Despite never visiting the campus until move in day of freshman year, I instantly fell in love with PNW and the people around me. At WWU I studied mathematics and computer science, completing my double major bachelor's degree in June 2018. During that time I discovered a passion for data science and machine learning, and I intend to continue pursuing these fields for the near and distant future.
